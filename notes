3 of same hull type can be banned

Only 3 of the same hull type can be banned. (For example, a ban list of a Vedmak, Vexor Navy Issue, Vexor, and Drekavac would be acceptable. A list of Hecate, Magus, Kikimora, and Thrasher Fleet Issue would not be acceptable.)

After the second round of bans, any duplicates will be discarded and a full list of bans will be given to the competing teams (this means the maximum theoretical list of banned ships in any given match has changed from 9 to 12)

The restrictions for hull type restrictions continue into the trickle ban phase. I.E if both teams ban 3 battleships and a battlecruiser, then no more battleships can be banned in the trickle bans, but 2 more battlecruisers can be banned (or any other ship hulls).

As a point of clarity – ships flagged as “Logistics” are a category of their own, so, for example only 3 of the following may be banned: Deacon / Kirin / Thalia / Scalpel / Augoror / Osprey / Exequror / Scythe / Guardian / Basilisk / Onerios / Scimitar / Rodiva / Zarmazd
